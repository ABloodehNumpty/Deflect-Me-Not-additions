This is a repository of changes/updates I personally incorporated for an Elden Ring mod called Deflect Me Not. This was all done with the permission and support of the mod author, and shared with their mod community.

Super Combos function lua file is a function change that allows for dedicated combos during DMN's 'super mode'.

DMNscript.py is a WIP python script that allows me to automatically apply updates to DMN for my updating needs.

There is a video example provided as well as patch notes that show the EXP37.1 update. EXP37.2 is in progress, working on the automation script.
