-- Below is an example moveset provided by a fellow user!
-- It is laid out in a way intended to allow you to config your moveset for both one-handing and two-handing your weapon as you please.
-- This moveset will work both one-handed/two-handed with Shortcuts disabled.


-- If you want to customize the moveset...
-- Simply add/change lines of combos as you please like below.

-- If you want to use a different weapon...
-- Simply copy and paste this to the chosen weapon's category and edit the moveset as you please like below.
-- e.g. [WEAPON_CATEGORY_LARGE_CURVEDSWORD] = {}

-- I personally recommend using "Visual Studio Code" for editing the file
-- It is neater than using Notepad.

-- Lines starting with '--' are quotes. You can remove these without issue.
-- There are some within the moveset to try help instruct you.


-- Great Katana moveset by ABloodehNumpty, kudos to Aikeutuido for his wonderful mod!
