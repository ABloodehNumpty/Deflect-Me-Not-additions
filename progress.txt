SUPER SEKIRO (Complete)

SUPER SEKIRO SKILLS
- Still need to do: DragonFlash1
- Go over melee moves again
- Go over unsheathing moves again

SUPER GENICHIRO
- Spark effects for unsheathing animations, try changing them to Malenia spark effects to see if they're nicer
- Genichiro15 is a lightning move, maybe make an alternate fire version so its consistent, have the lightning as an extra option?

SUPER GENICHIRO BOW
- No idea, lightning?
- hard to pair a magic bow and lightning without looking strange, perhaps color change the magic bow to yellow/gold?
- Perhaps change the color of the bow to red and apply fire damage as a super option?
- Rei mentioned perhaps actually adding a Bow model, thus removing the strange magical bow aspect, but I don't want to edit too much of the original mod
