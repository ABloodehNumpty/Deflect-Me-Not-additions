SUPER SEKIRO (Complete)

SUPER SEKIRO SKILLS
- Still need to do: DragonFlash1
- Go over melee moves again
- Go over unsheathing moves again

SUPER GENICHIRO
- Spark effects for unsheathing animations, try changing them to Malenia spark effects to see if they're nicer
- Genichiro15 is a lightning move, maybe make an alternate fire version so its consistent, have the lightning as an extra option?

SUPER GENICHIRO BOW
- No idea, lightning?
- hard to pair a magic bow and lightning without looking strange, perhaps color change the magic bow to yellow/gold?
- Perhaps change the color of the bow to red and apply fire damage as a super option?
- Rei mentioned perhaps actually adding a Bow model, thus removing the strange magical bow aspect, but I don't want to edit too much of the original mod

SUPER OWL (Complete)

SUPER LONE SHADOW (Complete)

SUPER ISSHIN
Unsheathing attacks - Isshin6, 7, 11, 18, 20, 23, 29


Future Ideas/Projects:

37.3: Adding a lite (and universal) version of super moves where it just applies a basic special effect (can use more than fire) during super mode. This would apply to more than just specific edited moves and would be overall a more refined method.

37.4: Mist Raven combo chainer effect. Somehow (don't know yet) copy and edit the Great Shinobi Owl #15 move to take the teleporting part of the move without the attack. Turn this into a move on its own, and use it as a combo cancel (either make it restart combo or continue the previous combo, or have its own combo system). The idea being to use it as a stylish dodge or distance closer for that true Sekiro customizable experience.
