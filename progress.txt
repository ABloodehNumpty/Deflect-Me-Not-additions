SUPER SEKIRO (Complete)

SUPER SEKIRO SKILLS (Complete except for DragonFlash1)
- Still need to do: DragonFlash1
- Go over melee moves again
- Go over unsheathing moves again

SUPER GENICHIRO
- Spark effects for unsheathing animations, try changing them to Malenia spark effects to see if they're nicer
- Genichiro15 is a lightning move, maybe make an alternate fire version so its consistent, have the lightning as an extra option?

SUPER GENICHIRO BOW
- No idea, lightning?
- hard to pair a magic bow and lightning without looking strange, perhaps color change the magic bow to yellow/gold?
- Perhaps change the color of the bow to red and apply fire damage as a super option?
- Rei mentioned perhaps actually adding a Bow model, thus removing the strange magical bow aspect, but I don't want to edit too much of the original mod

SUPER OWL (Complete)

SUPER LONE SHADOW (Complete)

SUPER ISSHIN (Complete)
Unsheathing attacks - Isshin6, 7, 11, 18, 20, 23, 29



Future Ideas/Projects:

37.3: Adding a lite (and universal) version of super moves where it just applies a basic special effect (can use more than fire) during super mode. This would apply to more than just specific edited moves and would be overall a more refined method.

Later (whether its 37.4/.5/onwards) can try designing a way of assigning the effects to certain moves, to allow for effect combos. Bare minimum, make it so combos starting with R1 have a different element to combos starting with R2. Lots of ways I could design this. The PERFECT way to do this would likely be something like:
{R1, R1, R1},
{Move1, Move2, Move3},
{Fire, Frost, Lightning}

Makes a combo where Move1 is fire, Move2 is frost, and move3 is lightning, allowing a mix-and-match with elements.

37.4: Mist Raven combo chainer effect. Somehow (don't know yet) copy and edit the Great Shinobi Owl #15 move to take the teleporting part of the move without the attack. Turn this into a move on its own, and use it as a combo cancel (either make it restart combo or continue the previous combo, or have its own combo system). The idea being to use it as a stylish dodge or distance closer for that true Sekiro customizable experience.
